# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

The **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game is a simple Python implementation of the classic hand game where you play against the computer. The player selects one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly chooses its option. The outcome is determined based on the traditional rules of the game.

## Features
- Play against a randomly generated computer choice.
- Validates the player's input to ensure a correct choice.
- Displays the result of each round (win, lose, or draw).

## How to Play
1. The player is prompted to choose one of the three options:
   - Type `0` for **Rock**
   - Type `1` for **Paper**
   - Type `2` for **Scissors**
2. The computer will also make its choice randomly.
3. The result is displayed based on the traditional rules:
   - **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
   - **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
   - **Paper** beats **Rock**.
   - If both the player and the computer choose the same option, itâ€™s a draw.
